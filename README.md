## leetcode practice

Going through the suggested problems at [this site](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/).
Eventually focusing on the more condensed list [here](https://leetcode.com/list/9h4lgwl2/), with guide of organizing that work [here](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions/)

Focusing on C++. The first solution is always mine off the top of my head and own research,
but sometimes I implement a second solution based on an algorithm someone else used whether it is in C++ or not.
